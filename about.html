              <h1>Well, who am I?</h1>
              <p>
                I am a highly driven creative who is always ready to get stuck in with anything challenging that enters my radar. I place heavy importance on community and enjoy working with great teams to get the best out of each and every member. I pride myself on the genuine impact my projects have, and the connections people make as a result of them. <br> <br>When I was at university, I was disappointed by the lack of community and practical skill teaching within the studios, mainly due to the lingering affects of COVID. As a result I set up a society dedicated to bringing creative students together, and teaching them new skills. <br><br>After just 2 years, we had a total of 120 members and a thriving community. My team and I have taught a variety of workshops, often developing our own skills in order to keep the range of workshops we run diverse and engaging. It was one of the most enjoyable and fulfilling parts of my university experience, and I have continued this ethos of learning through collaboration into my practise.<br><br>With a dedication to good communication and time management, I thrive in a bustling environment which involves teamwork as well as individual work. I am always looking for ways to learn something new, and never shy away from a challenge. (I say this as someone who spent 4 days straight learning html and css so I could program this website from scratch, just because I could.)<br><br>Iâ€™d love to hear what you have to say, so please feel free to send me an email. <br></p>
